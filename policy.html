        <h3>1. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
        <div class="text">

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes your privacy rights regarding our collection, use, storage, sharing and protection of your personal information. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user. This Privacy Policy applies to the website of Cleanify, Inc. (“Cleanify”) and all related sites, applications, and services regardless of how you access or use them.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>2. Scope and Consent</h3>

            <p>You accept this Privacy Policy when you sign up for, access, or use our services, including, but not limited to, our technologies, processes, or functions offered on our website and all related sites, applications, customer service team, cleaners, and third-party vendors, all of which we refer to simply as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy is intended to govern the use of the Services by our users (including, without limitation those who use the Services in the course of their trade or business) unless otherwise agreed through contract. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>3. Collection of Personal Information</h3>
        <div class="text">

            <p>We collect the following types of personal information in order to provide you with the use of the Services, and to help us personalize and improve your experience.

                A. Information We Collect Automatically
